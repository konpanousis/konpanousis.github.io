# About Me
---

I'm an assistant professor in the Statistics Department at the Athens University of Economics and Business, specializing in statistical machine learning, with a strong focus on interpretable AI, Bayesian deep learning, and multimodal models. I obtained my PhD from the National and Kapodistrian University of Athens, where I explored non-parametric Bayesian methods for deep neural networks, and my MRes in Computational Statistics and Machine Learning from University College London. I have worked at leading institutions such as INRIA, Cyprus University of Technology, and NCSR Demokritos where I developed cutting-edge deep learning models with applications in cybersecurity, plant species identification, and sign language translation, and I have been a part of several EU research programs. Apart from research, I'm also teaching machine learning, databases and data science at both undergraduate and postgraduate levels. I mainly focus on Machine/Deep Learning, and Bayesian modeling, with a deep interest in building interpretable, robust, and generalizable AI systems.
